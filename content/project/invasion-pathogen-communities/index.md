**Native and exotic grass densities have similar effects on foliar fungal pathogen communities and disease severity**  

The biodiversity of ecological communities can have important impacts on disease burdens. One mechanism explaining this phenomenon is that changes in diversity can be related to changes in the densities of highly competent host species (i.e., species that are highly susceptible to infection and can easily transmit pathogens to new hosts). Plant invasions typically decrease biodiversity while the density of the invader increases, sometimes drastically. Therefore, any differences between invasive and native species in their competence for pathogens are likely to result in altered pathogen communities and disease burdens following invasion. We examined foliar fungal pathogen communities associated with native and exotic grasses across observational and manipulated densities of native and exotic grasses in a California grassland to address the following aims: (1) Characterize foliar fungal pathogen communities associated with native and exotic grasses; (2) Evaluate the effects of host status (i.e., native/exotic) on the relationship between grass density and pathogen relative abundance; and (3) Evaluate the effects of host status on the relationship between grass density and pathogen damage. We found that native and exotic grasses hosted distinct pathogen communities but were both infected by overlapping generalist pathogens. Native grasses experienced higher pathogen damage. The densities of both native and exotic species promoted fungal damage and altered the relative abundances of some pathogen species while having limited effects on most. While invasive species may cultivate distinct pathogen communities from co-occurring native species, we found that exotic grasses do not have unique effects on pathogen relative abundance and damage in California grasslands.
