**Host nutrient supply mediates facilitation and competition between plant viruses**  

Ecological theory that predicts the effects of resource availability on species interactions has been explored across a range of systems. Yet, application of this theory to communities of host-associated pathogens has been limited. Host resources and diet can impact disease severity and prevalence, and these resource effects on disease may be mediated by pathogen-pathogen interactions within hosts infected with multiple pathogens. As with free-living organisms, pathogen species can alter each otherâ€™s population growth rates, population densities, and transmission to new hosts through facilitative or antagonistic processes. We used a model grass-virus system (Barley and Cereal Yellow Dwarf Viruses) to test the hypothesis that host nutrition can constrain virus-virus interactions by simultaneously determining both within-host density and transmission to new hosts. Hosts (oats) were grown in growth chambers with different concentrations of soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and infected with one or both viruses (i.e., coinfection). We quantified the impacts of nutrient addition on virus-virus interactions through within-host density (i.e., the concentration of viruses in a plant) and transmission to new hosts. Nutrients promoted facilitation of one virus (CYDV-RPV) through increased density (elevated N) and increased transmission (elevated N and P) with coinfection relative to single infection. The other virus (BYDV-PAV) experienced facilitation through increased density when nutrients were limited, but nutrient addition led to antagonistic effects of coinfection on density (elevated N and P) and transmission (elevated N). Our results highlight opportunities for novel insights from testing predictions of community ecology in disease systems, including nutrient-dependent facilitation and nutrient-mediated interactions during transmission that were not predicted by within-host dynamics. This study contributes to the growing literature on ecological interactions among coinfecting pathogens by demonstrating that resource availability can mediate pathogen-pathogen interactions both within hosts and during transmission.

**Viruses are likely to coexist regardless of soil N and P concentrations**  

Individual plants and animals are frequently infected with multiple pathogens, motivating the question of how different pathogens coexist given overlapping niches. Resource availability and dispersal between patches affect coexistence of free-living organisms and also may mediate pathogen coexistence. Barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (B/CYDVs) commonly coinfect grasses, and soil nutrients affect their within-host growth rates and infection prevalence. However, it is unclear if soil nutrients and transmission between hosts contribute to high coinfection rates by promoting coexistence. We evaluated the effects of nutrients on B/CYDV coexistence by growing oats with full factorial nitrogen and phosphorus addition and performing mutual invasion trials with two viruses. We also carried out transmission trials from singly- and coinfected plants to understand coexistence at the host population scale. While nutrient addition enhanced within-host growth and transmission and modified viral interactions, within-host mutual invasions were successful in all nutrient treatments. Dynamical model simulations demonstrated that within-host coexistence can buffer against competition during transmission to allow coexistence at the host population scale. By testing community ecology theory in a plant virus system, we found that within-host coexistence mechanisms are likely to maintain B/CYDV coinfection in the field across a range of environmental resource supply rates.
