**How does management of aquatic invasive plants affect Florida lakes?**  

Florida is home to thousands of lakes, which host biodiverse ecosystems and serve as sources of recreation and livelihood for Florida's citizens. Aquatic invasive plants have colonized lakes across the state, impacting their ecology and hydrology. Managers use herbicides to control aquatic invasive species such as hydrilla (*Hydrilla verticillata*), water hyacinth (*Eichhornia crassipes*), and water lettuce (*Pistia stratiotes*). However, herbicide use in Florida lakes has become a public concern. Concerned stakeholders find value in maintaining some populations of aquatic invasive species and worry about the side effects of herbicides. We are analyzing long-term datasets to evaluate the effects of invasive plants on lake ecosystems and the impacts of their management. Our datasets come from government agencies and citizen scientists--people who live, work, and play on Florida's lakes.
