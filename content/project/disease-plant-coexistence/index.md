**Effects of pathogen accumulation on native-invasive plant interactions**  

Invasive species can escape pathogens when they are introduced to a new range, which may provide them with a competitive advantage over native species. However, mounting evidence suggests that invasive species accumulate pathogens over time, some of which are generalists that can emerge from native species and spillback to them. Changes in host fitness due to disease can lead to multiple outcomes of competition: coexistence, exclusion, or priority effects. The few studies that have evaluated the impacts of pathogen accumulation on invaded communities have found that it promotes coexistence or suppresses native species. However, recent evidence suggests that emerging fungal pathogens in the genus *Bipolaris* can suppress the invasive grass, *Microstegium vimineum*, favoring native species. The goal of this research is to characterize the current and long-term effects of fungal pathogen accumulation on competition between *M. vimineum* and native species. We employ field experiments, greenhouse experiments, and modeling to assess how fungal infection alters the outcome of competition between *M. vimineum* and native perennial grasses. We monitored plant performance and infection within constructed communities of *M. vimineum* and a native grass species at invaded field sites where disease severity was mitigated through repeated fungicide applications. In the greenhouse, we extended this research to understand how a wide range of *M. vimineum* densities affects the growth and disease prevalence of multiple native grass species. We also used a greenhouse experiment to examine the potential for senesced *M. vimineum* biomass, which accumulates in invaded areas, to affect disease transmission and competition. We used data from our experiments and the literature to parameterize a discrete-time plant competition model.
