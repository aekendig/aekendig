**Modeling nutrient and disease dynamics in a plant-pathogen system**  

Human activities alter elemental nutrient cycling, which can have profound impacts on agriculture, grasslands, lakes, and other systems. It is becoming increasingly clear that enhanced nitro- gen and phosphorus levels can affect disease dynamics across a range of taxa. However, there are few mathematical models that explicitly incorporate nutrients into host-pathogen interactions. Using viral load and plant mass data from an experiment with cereal yellow dwarf virus and its host plant, Avena sativa, we propose and compare two models describing the overall infection dynamics. However, the first model considers nutrient-limited virus production while the other considers a nutrient-induced vi- ral production delay. A virus reproduction number is derived for this nutrient model, which depends on environmental and physiological attributes. Results suggest that including nutrient mediated viral pro- duction mechanisms can give rise to robust models that can be used to untangle how nutrients impact pathogen dynamics.

**Soil nutrients and coinfection mediate the virulence of plant virus infections**  

Pathogens induce harmful effects on their hosts (i.e. virulence) due, in part, to ecological interactions and abiotic conditions that affect host or pathogen fitness. To test the hypothesis that resource availability and coinfection interact to mediate virulence, we infected oat plants with one or two viruses along an experimentally manipulated nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) soil gradient. Infection reduced shoot mass and chlorophyll content, and N addition increased shoot mass and reduced the disease-induced chlorophyll losses. Coinfection caused more severe mass loss than single infection, but within-host virus density was only weakly associated with plant growth. We developed and parameterized a model to evaluate the relationship between nutrient addition and virulence across a range of biological scenarios. Nutrient addition influenced virulence most when pathogen resource-use caused mass loss. For two other mechanisms behind mass loss, increasing nutrients that enhanced host or pathogen growth had little effect on virulence. Our empirical results and model demonstrated that, in contrast to theoretical expectations, resource-mediated interactions between pathogens or between the host and pathogen do not always affect virulence due to the diversity of pathways through which pathogens cause harm to the host.
